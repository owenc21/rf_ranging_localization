# RF-Based Ranging for Relative Localization

## "Walking Skeleton"

- To begin, we have initialized our repository to contain all of the necessary documents and API references needed for development
  - An API reference can be found in `/Doc/DW3xxx_Driver_API_Guide_6.0.14.pdf`
  - A guide for using the software development kit (SDK) can be found in `/Doc/DWM3001CDK_SDK_Developer_Guide_0.1.1.pdf`
- We are still awaiting the arrival of at least one micro-USB to USB-A adapter for communication with devices
  - The first task in our next sprint will be writing and testing a basic "hello word" equivalent program on the devices
